FizzBuzz
==================================================================

###A FizzBuzz implementation used to learn github, ruby, TDD, & ruby gems

This is a simple FizzBuzz application that I've over engineered to
get some practice using ruby to create larger systems. I'm also 
using this project to practice TDD and figure out how to develope
ruby gems to gain a better understanding of how they work.
